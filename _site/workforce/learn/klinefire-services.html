    <h2>KLINEFIRE SERVICES</h2>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>KlineFire Services had not updated our operating system in nearly ten years, and were using a program which required extensive management from the administration team.  Each of the up to 2,000 sites required four separate “contracts”, and invoicing involved manually entering a price against each item.  This would result in delays getting invoices to clients.</p>
      <p>We were at a point where the operating system was holding us back, and it was time for a major change.</p>
      <p class="blockquote">Uptick gave us the opportunity to move to a modern, cloud based system which would give us the ability to obtain more in-depth information from the servicing technician.</p>
      <p>When attending site, our technicians have access to all the information we have on record (photos, contact details and other equipment) in the palm of their hand.  This saw an immediate reduction in the number of calls to the office from the techs on the road, freeing up administration time which would have otherwise been spent trawling through archived records.</p>
      <p>While completing the service, the technician is able to take photos of any items of concern and obtain signatures from site contacts as a proof of attendance.  The task also lists the exact time the technician was on site, which can be referred back to at a later date if queried.  This has been particularly beneficial to the body corporates and property mangers who are not on site while works take place.</p>
      <p>As the system operates in real time, works can be invoiced immediately upon completion.  Clients appreciate the prompt delivery of information, and it means we can collect revenue much faster. Furthermore, as a fire protection maintenance provider, we have a duty of care to ensure that all documents are issued promptly and correctly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>The flexibility of a cloud based system has allowed our office based staff to take their work with them while they are off site.  When they attend meetings with clients they are armed with all the data we have on file, and have the flexibility of working from home if needed.</p>
      <p>But our favourite feature is the Operations Dashboard, which provides real time updates about the work our technicians and administration staff are completing.  This has given us a better idea of what our team are doing, and enabled us to improve the day to day running of the business.</p>
      <p>The feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive.  The information we are providing following a service is more comprehensive, and documents are sent almost immediately after the service.  In addition, our quote approvals have dramatically increased, as clients are now just one click away from approving works.<p>
      <p>Joining Uptick has launched KlineFire in to today's connected world, and has allowed us to tailor servicing packages for our clients which separate us from our competitors.  We look forward to utilising Uptick even more as our client base grows.</p>
