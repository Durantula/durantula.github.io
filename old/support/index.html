                    For requests that require significant developer time, e.g. new features or adjustments to core functionality, we make a best effort to include this as part of your subscription.

                  <li>
                    These requests should be made via the support channel or an email to your account manager.

                    If this is not possible weâ€™ll provide an estimate for when the functionality might be available, or a quote for building it as a priority.
