  	<h2>AMBULANCE VICTORIA</h2>
    <p>With the state of each lodge managed individually gathering a picture of our overall compliance was incredibly difficult and accurately allocating funds for repairs near on impossible.</p>
    <p>Preventitive maintenance provided one of the biggest headaches, with each lodge being maintained separately we were never able to reap the cost benefits of having a portfolio our size.</p>
    <p class="blockquote">Uptick to the rescue.</p>
    <p>Uptickâ€™ Facilities Management module allowed us to visualize our portfolio in a way unlike ever before. Using their analytics tools we could easily see a complete snapshot of our entire portfolio's compliance and quickly determine which issues to address first.</p>
    <p>With the help of Uptick we were able to manage all of our 4500 assets right down to each individual door. Having all the assets in one centralized location enabled us to better plan out upcoming scheduled maintenance, allowing contractors to quote across our entire portfolio rather than on a per lodge basis.</p>
    <p>As a Non-Profit organisation Uptick instills our board with great confidence that all risk incurred in our lodges is delt with promptly and responsibly. Ensuring the continuance of our great organisation. </p>
