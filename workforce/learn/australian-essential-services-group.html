    <h2>AUSTRALIAN ESSENTIAL SERVICES GROUP</h2>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>AESG was a mid-sized Building Safety Systems audit Company. It managed approximately 8,000 buildings throughout Australia – mostly in Victoria.</p>
      <p>For each property, AESG would send out an Auditor to inspect individual elements within the building, determine its compliance and then record the results on inspection forms. For many of the buildings the inspections took place once every 3 months on a strict timetable.</p>
      <p>Those forms were then transferred manually into an Access datUpticke by a team of dedicated data entry clerks. Reports were manually compiled and individually sent to customers.</p>
      <p>You can imagine the storm of paperwork that occurred each month.</p>
      <p>The sheer complexity and volume of forms, correspondence and reports meant that AESG was barely keeping its head above water. The nature of the business meant that the Company had a duty of care to its clients; it had to be reliable and accurate.</p>
      <p>AESG had reached a point where in order to grow, it had to take hold of its processes.</p>
      <p class="blockquote">Uptick provided a means for AESG to regain control.</p>
      <p>Uptick’ Field Services module allows AESG to distribute tasks to each of its Auditors without bringing them into the office to collect their folders. The IPAD application provides real time information that is both richer and much more accurate. The Auditors can spend more of their time inspecting the buildings and adding value to their reports.</p>
      <p>As soon as an Inspection is complete, the results become available to AESG’s clients through the Cloud Based Portal. Uptick provides a feature rich platform of Asset Intelligence. Building Managers can log on wherever they are and properly understand the compliance status of their entire portfolio both as individual buildings and as a whole.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>Uptick records are securely hosted in the Cloud. Current and past inspections, correspondence, documents and everything associated with a property or a client can be searched and reported on. When an enquiry comes into the AESG office, the information can be retrieved quickly and reliably. Uptick facilitates a genuinely paperless office.</p>
      <p>Now that AESG has adopted the Uptick platform it can move more quickly to being paid. When a service agreement has been fulfilled, an invoice is issued reliably via Xero. Uptick is fully integrated with Xero as one of their preferred suppliers.</p>
      <p>With the control of processes comes the ability to analyse. AESG now understands much more about its own business. The performance of its staff can be better monitored, the ongoing status of its monthly operations can be analysed and potential problems identified before they become an issue. Staff are now comfortably on top of their responsibilities and morale and productivity has escalated.</p>
      <p>Since adopting Uptick in 2014, AESG’s portfolio has grown by approximately 30%. Prior to Uptick that growth would have been unthinkable.</p>
      <p>Each new month has become a record for Inspections completed, reports generated and revenue collected. Our staff numbers have fallen and others have been redeployed to more valuable activities. Our overall production costs have gone down. There is now much greater capacity to add extra services to our offerings and additional value to our clients.</p>
